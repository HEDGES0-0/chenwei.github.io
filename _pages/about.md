<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Chen Wei**, a joint Ph.D. candidate in **Psychology** at the University of Birmingham (UK) and the Southern University of Science and Technology (China), expected to graduate in September 2025. My research is centered on **Artificial Intelligence for Cognitive Science (AI4CogSci)**, aiming to integrate **generative AI and human behavioral modeling** to build new experimental paradigms that can effectively predict and regulate complex human behaviors.

Through **adaptive experiments, large-scale behavioral data, and controllable generative models**, I work across various domains from visual perception and decision-making to aesthetics and affective states. I have published over **10 first-/corresponding-author papers** in top-tier venues including **NeurIPS, ICML, IJCAI, and The Innovation**, accumulating more than **400 citations** and an **H-index of 7**.
